      <p>In 2009 my late grandfather Clifford Godfrey started it all. A kettle corn business. In Palmer Alaska my grandfather bought the equipment and ingredients and got to popping. Fairs, Farmer's Markets and Friday Flings were arranged. As a child I remember attending all of these events to see my grandfather and for my older sisters to go work with him. He didn't like people much, so my sisters handled all the customer service while he cooked delicious hot kettle corn. My Grandpa loved it, my sisters loved it, and I loved being under foot causing havoc as an energetic 9 year old. And as far as I could tell the people loved it, because it sold like hot cakes. Everything was going awesome.</p>
